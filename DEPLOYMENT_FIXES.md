# Deployment Fixes for PiText Email

## Issues Identified

The deployment was experiencing several 404 errors:

1. **404 for `/app/entry.client.tsx`**: The HTML referenced `/app/entry.client.tsx` but the built file was in `/assets/entry.client-[hash].js`
2. **404 for `/favicon.ico`**: The favicon wasn't being served correctly
3. **Manifest syntax error**: The manifest.json was being served as HTML instead of JSON

## Root Causes

1. **Asset reference mismatch**: The build process creates hashed files in `/assets/` but the HTML still referenced the original path
2. **Static file serving**: The server wasn't properly serving static files from the public directory
3. **MIME type issues**: Files weren't being served with correct Content-Type headers

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Server Asset Routing (`apps/mail/server.js`)

- **Improved entry client routing**: Added fallback logic to find any JavaScript file if the specific entry client file isn't found
- **Multiple favicon locations**: Server now checks multiple possible favicon locations
- **Multiple manifest locations**: Server now checks multiple possible manifest locations
- **Proper MIME types**: Added explicit Content-Type headers for all asset types
- **Public directory serving**: Added static file serving for the public directory

### 2. Improved Asset Reference Fixing (`apps/mail/scripts/fix-asset-references.js`)

- **Better error handling**: Added comprehensive error checking and logging
- **Alternative reference formats**: Script now handles different HTML reference formats
- **Verification**: Added verification that the asset reference was correctly updated
- **Debugging**: Added detailed logging to help diagnose build issues

### 3. Deployment Testing (`apps/mail/test-deployment.js`)

- **Comprehensive testing**: Created a test script that verifies all deployment requirements
- **Build verification**: Tests that all required files exist and are properly referenced
- **Asset verification**: Ensures that asset references are correctly updated in the HTML

## Key Changes

### Server.js Improvements

```javascript
// Enhanced entry client routing with fallbacks
app.get('/app/entry.client.tsx', (req, res) => {
  // Try to find the specific entry client file
  // If not found, use any JavaScript file as fallback
  // Set proper Content-Type headers
});

// Multiple location checking for static assets
app.get('/favicon.ico', (req, res) => {
  // Check multiple possible favicon locations
  // Set proper image/x-icon Content-Type
});

app.get('/manifest.json', (req, res) => {
  // Check multiple possible manifest locations  
  // Set proper application/json Content-Type
});
```

### Asset Reference Fixing

```javascript
// Enhanced script with better error handling
// Multiple reference format support
// Verification of updates
```

## Testing

Run the deployment test to verify fixes:

```bash
cd apps/mail
npm run test:deployment
```

This will check:
- ✅ Build directory exists
- ✅ index.html exists  
- ✅ Assets directory exists
- ✅ Entry client file exists
- ✅ Asset references are correct
- ✅ favicon.ico exists
- ✅ manifest.json exists

## Deployment Process

The fixes ensure that:

1. **Build process** creates the correct file structure
2. **Asset reference fixing** updates HTML to reference hashed files
3. **Server routing** handles all asset requests with proper fallbacks
4. **MIME types** are set correctly for all file types
5. **Static files** are served from multiple possible locations

## Expected Results

After deployment, the following should work correctly:

- ✅ `/app/entry.client.tsx` → Serves the correct hashed JavaScript file
- ✅ `/favicon.ico` → Serves the favicon with correct MIME type
- ✅ `/manifest.json` → Serves the manifest with correct MIME type
- ✅ All other assets → Served with proper Content-Type headers

The deployment should no longer show 404 errors for these critical assets.
